# Symbolic AI

Symbolic AI, also known as "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" (GOFAI), is an approach to artificial intelligence that relies on the manipulation of symbols and the use of explicit rules to represent knowledge and perform reasoning. Unlike modern machine learning techniques, which often rely on statistical methods and large amounts of data, symbolic AI focuses on using structured, human-readable representations of problems and applying logical operations to solve them.

# Examples of Symbolic AI Systems:
Expert Systems: These are designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain. Examples include MYCIN for medical diagnosis and DENDRAL for chemical analysis.
Logic Programming: Languages like Prolog are based on symbolic AI principles, allowing developers to define relationships and rules that the system uses to solve problems.
Knowledge Representation: Ontologies and semantic networks are used to represent complex relationships between concepts in a way that can be processed by AI systems.

# Symbolic AI in Modern AI:
While symbolic AI has been largely overshadowed by machine learning and neural network approaches in recent years, it still plays a role in certain applications where interpretability, explicit knowledge representation, and logical reasoning are crucial. Moreover, there is growing interest in hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of symbolic AI and machine learning to create more robust and versatile AI systems.
