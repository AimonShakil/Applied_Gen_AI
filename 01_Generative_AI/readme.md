What are Neural Networks, and how they are used to build LLMs
Let's explain neural networks and how they are used to build large language models (LLMs).

What is a Neural Network?
Imagine a neural network like a big team of tiny robots that work together to solve problems, just like how your brain works. Each robot is called a "neuron," and they are connected to each other, passing messages (called "signals") back and forth.

Building Blocks of a Neural Network
Neurons:

Think of neurons like little workers who have specific tasks. They receive information, do some calculations, and then pass the information to the next worker.
Layers:

Neurons are organized into groups called layers. There are three main types of layers:
Input Layer: This is where the network gets information from the outside world. For example, if youâ€™re trying to teach the network to recognize words, the input layer would get the words as input.
Hidden Layers: These are layers between the input and output layers. They do the heavy lifting of figuring out complex patterns.
Output Layer: This is where the network gives you the result. For example, it might tell you what word it thinks youâ€™re talking about.
How Neural Networks Learn
Training:

The neural network learns by looking at lots of examples. For instance, if you want it to understand language, you show it lots of sentences and tell it what they mean.
Each neuron has a little thing called a "weight" that it uses to decide how important its part of the task is. At first, these weights are random, but as the network looks at more examples, it adjusts the weights to get better at the task.
Adjusting Weights:

If the network makes a mistake, it adjusts the weights to try and make a better guess next time. This process is called "learning."
Types of Neural Networks Used in LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) like the ones used in chatbots are built using special types of neural networks. Here are some common ones:

Feedforward Neural Networks:

These are the simplest type. Information moves in one direction, from input to output, through the hidden layers.
Think of it like a relay race where each runner passes the baton to the next runner.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

These are a bit more complex. They are good at understanding sequences, like sentences, because they can remember previous information.
Imagine a storybook where each page reminds you of what happened on the previous pages.
Transformer Networks:

These are the most advanced and powerful for language tasks. They look at all the words in a sentence at once and figure out how they are related.
Think of it like having a super-smart friend who can read a whole story at once and understand how all the parts connect.
Example: Building a Simple Language Model
Let's say we want to build a simple language model that can predict the next word in a sentence.

Input Layer: The network gets a sentence, like "The cat is on the".
Hidden Layers: The hidden layers try to understand the sentence. They look at each word and how they connect.
Output Layer: The network guesses the next word. In this case, it might guess "mat" because it has learned that "The cat is on the mat" is a common phrase.
How LLMs Use These Networks
LLMs like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and LLaMA use very large transformer networks. They have millions or even billions of neurons working together. These models have been trained on huge amounts of text data, so they are very good at understanding and generating human-like text.

Training: They look at lots of sentences, stories, and books to learn patterns in the language.
Understanding: They can understand the context of a conversation and respond in a meaningful way.
Summary
Neural networks are like teams of tiny robots (neurons) working together to solve problems. They learn by adjusting their weights based on lots of examples. Different types of neural networks, like feedforward, recurrent, and transformer networks, are used to build powerful language models that can understand and generate text. These large language models are very smart because they have been trained on a huge amount of text data, allowing them to understand and respond to language in a human-like way.

Modern LLMs are primarily built using transformer networks due to their superior ability to handle long-range dependencies, parallelize computations, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. RNNs and other models were more common in earlier language models but have been largely superseded by transformers in cutting-edge LLMs.
